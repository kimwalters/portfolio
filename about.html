    <h2>The Facts.</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Kim. I have always been interested in the web for as long as I can remember. When I was in the fifth grade I made my first website using www.angelfire.com, I think I started a beanie baby blog. As I grew older I started taking more of an interest in print design. In 2009 I recieved a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a specialization in Graphic Design from Central Washington University.</p>
    <p>Of course there is more to me than just my want to work in web design. Here are some of my highlights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I've traveled to 11 different countries, including studying abroad in Ireland and helping manage a boutique hotel in Mexico.</li>
      <li>I worked as a waitress and hostess throughout highschool and college.</li>
      <li>I've been skydiving.</li>
      <li>I lived in Hawaii, on Molokai the fifth smallest islands for 8 months after college working on their local newspaper.</li>
      <li>My favorite sea animal is the blue whale.</li>
    </ul>
